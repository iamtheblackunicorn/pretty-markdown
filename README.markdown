# PRETTY MARKDOWN :nail_care:

***Generate pretty HTML from your Markdown files.*** :nail_care:

## About :books:

I was writing some Markdown the other day and wanted to generate some HTML from it. I looked for the tools to do so and found them. I generated the HTML from my Markdown files and discovered, to my disappointment, that the generated HTML was quite ugly. So, I decided to write a small command-line tool that takes two arguments as input and outputs some good-looking HTML. The first argument is the path of your Markdown files (obviously!) and the second is the path of a stylesheet, remote or local.

## Usage :hammer:

You will need the following tools installed and available from the command-line.

- Python 3.x
- Colorama for Python 3.x.
- Markdown for Python 3.x.

You will also need the path of your stylesheet.

- 1.) Download the tool from [here]().
- 2.) Place in the same directory as your Markdown files.
- 4.) Open a command-prompt and run the following command.
```
$ python pmd.py . thepathofyourstylesheet.css
```
- 6.) Enjoy!
